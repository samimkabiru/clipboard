## My process

- I buit this website using the mobile-first approach.
- I divided the style sheet into logical sections.
- I also built the website using the bottom-up aproach.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

- I intend to focus on practicing more projects that require grid layout.
- My foundation isn't solid on the css box model as well so I intend to practice it more.

### Useful resources

- [Cloud convert](https://cloudconvert.com/) - cloud convert is an online tool that can be use to convert images from one format to another. It really came to my aid because I couldn't purchase an adobe photoshop plan. I recommend it for any one who doesn't have money to pay for adobe photoshop.

- [Responsive breakpoints](https://responsivebreakpoints.com/) - This is an amazing online resizer which helped me resize images. Highly recommended.
